# DeepResearch Assistant

## Overview
DeepResearch Assistant is a comprehensive prompt system designed to transform Large Language Models into rigorous research assistants. This system orchestrates a three-part workflow that mimics academic research processes to produce authoritative, evidence-based analyses on complex topics.

## Key Components

### The Archivist (Knowledge Curator)
The first component focuses on comprehensive literature review, identifying high-quality academic sources, evaluating methodological rigor, and ensuring diverse scholarly perspectives.

### The Weaver (Evidence Synthesist)
The second component extracts, analyzes, and integrates complex information from multiple sources, organizing evidence by theme and strength while critically evaluating quality and limitations.

### The Sage (Knowledge Architect)
The final component crafts comprehensive analyses with precise research questions, structured logical frameworks, and evidence-based conclusions while maintaining appropriate academic rigor and citation practices.

## Usage

1. Copy the entire prompt system into your preferred LLM interface as a **system prompt**
2. Modify the prompt as needed for your specific research needs
3. Submit your research query as a **user prompt**
4. The system will guide the LLM to produce a comprehensive research analysis following academic standards

## Features

- Prioritizes peer-reviewed and authoritative sources
- Evaluates methodological quality and evidence strength
- Identifies areas of scholarly consensus and disagreement
- Maintains appropriate epistemic humility
- Produces structured research outputs with proper citations
- Distinguishes between facts, consensus views, and interpretations

## Output Format

The system produces research reports with the following structure:
- Executive summary
- Background and context
- Methodology
- Evidence analysis by theme
- Synthesis and implications
- Future research directions
- References

## Limitations

- Effectiveness depends on the capabilities of the underlying LLM
- Requires internet access for research capabilities
- Limited by the LLM's knowledge cutoff date for recent developments if no internet access available
